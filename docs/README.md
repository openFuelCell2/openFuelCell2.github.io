# openFuelCell2

openFuelCell2 is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toolbox for simulating electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and electrolysis. The solver is based on the open-source library, OpenFOAM®.


## About the code

The source code was developed from a previous open-source repository called [openFuelCell](http://openfuelcell.sourceforge.net/). It was also inspired by the standard solver **reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam** in OpenFOAM®. The solver can consider coupled problems with multi-region and multi-physics issues, including single and two phase flows, multiple species components, charger transfer, and electrochemical reactions in different regions. More applications and solvers will be available in the future.


## Running your own simulations

To install the openFuelCell2 libraries, please follow this [installation guide](installation/README.md).

Then, to test the tutorial cases, please see the [tutorial guide](tutorials/README.md).
