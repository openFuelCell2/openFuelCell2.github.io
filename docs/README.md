# openFuelCell2

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver for electrochemical devices, including fuel cell and electrolysis. The solver is developed based on the open-source library, OpenFOAM.

## About the code

---

The source code was developed from a previous open-source repository [openFuelCell2](http://openfuelcell.sourceforge.net/). It was also inspired from the standard solver "reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam" in OpenFOAM. The solver can be used to consider the coupled problem with multi-region and multi-physics issues, including single and two phase flows, multiple species components, charger transfer, and electrochemical reactions in different regions. More applications and solvers will be available in the future.

## How to run your own simulations

---

For the installation of the openFuelCell2 libraries see [installation guide](installation/README.md) and for running the tutorial cases [tutorial guide](tutorials/README.md).
